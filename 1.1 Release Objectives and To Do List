1.1 Release Objectives:
  As the first mod Release, the goals are rather basic(although still open to discussion): It will include AT LEAST 3 blocks and 2 items. 
  The 3 blocks shall include: a basic Computer-like device that can switch between an I/O mode, take three redstone values, save the values,
  and send it via a network to another Computer which can output these redstone values; An ethernet cable, which can plug into a computer in
  one end and plug into either a computer or Ethernet Hub on the other end; and an Ethernet Hub to establish basic Networking capabilites. 
  The 2 items will simply be resources used in the crafting recipies of the following blocks; idealy, these crafting recipies will be in the
  the first Release, although I don't think it's neccassary.

Notation:
  ** indicates essential tasks/group; once all essential task are met, 1.1 Release will go live and a new To-Do list will be generated.¹
   * indicates that the task still needs to be done.²
  XX indicates that the task has been fully completed.
   X indicates that an essential task has had all essential subtasks completed, and thus will not stop a Release from going live. 
   - is followed by the person assaigned to the task.
   
   ¹When a new To-Do list is generated, new objectives will be discussed and I will properly notate the next To-Do list, generate a
    changelog, and archieve the Release objectives
   ²It is important to note that essential tasks can have non-essential subtasks. In the case of an update going live while an essential
    task still has uncompleted non-essential tasks, these tasks whill be role-overed to the next To-Do list; note that this means that if
    a task has a single "X" when the update goes live, it will appear in the next To-Do list.
